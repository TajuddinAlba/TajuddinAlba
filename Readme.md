## 🧠 Thesis & Research

**Modern security exploit analysis and mitigation** — A study of OWASP vulnerabilities, supply-chain threats, zero-day mitigations, and recommended DevSecOps practices.  
Local copy: `/mnt/data/Modern security exploit analysis and mitigation.pdf` — swap to a hosted link for public sharing.

## 📂 How I Work (Workflow / Dev Practices)

1. Plan & model: requirement → architecture → threat model
2. Implement with tests (unit & integration) and code reviewers
3. CI pipeline: lint → test → security scan → build → deploy
4. Post-deploy: monitor + quick rollback / canary deploys

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech I Use

`VSCode` · `Git` · `Docker` · `Postman` · `Linux` · `Chrome DevTools` · `Figma` (basic) · `GitHub Actions` · `Snyk`/`Trivy`
